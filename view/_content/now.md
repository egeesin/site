I'm currently learning Godot Engine to see if I can actually make my ideas a reality and to see if I can make fun games. Recently participated as solo dev in Ludum Dare 55 Compo to make a "Draw a perfect pentagram" game like Neal's "Draw a perfect circle" but couldn't finished it as I like. Will keep learning the engine. My first impressions on GDScript are positive so far.
