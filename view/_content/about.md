My name is **Ege Esin**. I'm a Gen Z Turk born at Antalya, Turkiye in autumn of '98. Learned swimming at the pool and Konyaalti Beach. Played numerous video games on my white 2009-model MacBook gifted by my father, my big brother's Game Boy Color (threw it from the window of 4th floor after I lost a game and my temper which might be counted as my first official ragequitâ€¦) and his PlayStation Portable (didn't throw this one), bootleg NES called Micro Genius and still currently playing on my custom Windows PC.


In my childhood, I tried to replicate popular logos in Flash MX Professional on my father's old graphite 2000-model iMac and much older Packward Bell PC for fun and challenge. Eventually became power user of macOS, Arch Linux, Vim and graphic tools from Adobe. Aside of tinkering with graphic tools, I was blogging back in 2008 with WordPress. Wrote about random stuff and games that I liked including Cartoon Network's unfortunately shortlived MMORPG game FusionFall. During my not-so-productive-and-social high school times, I self-studied web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JS, Sass to make and tinker my own website after I've been thinking I was too limited and bored of free-to-use WordPress themes.

I've met my high school art teacher who taught me and my friends to improve our drawing skills in her workshop which led me to enter university in 2017. Been in Istanbul where I finished my middle school and Eskisehir where I studied and got bachelor's degree at Anadolu University - Faculty of Fine Arts, Graphic Design in 2021. I've learned valuable principles of design, typography, visual communication, press techniques and pictography back there.


Got hit by COVID-19 pandemic metaphorically by the graduation year and started participating online activites increasingly with my friends in a communication platform called Discord. Met new people and communities that paved the way to join a gamejam event with one of my friends and new people we just met to make our first game in MAGARA Jam #3 in 2021. Knowing the interaction was priceless, I kept participating in teams as pixel/2D artist and gave constructive feedback to other participants, talked about each others pros/cons in voice channels. And here we are [now](/now) so far!
